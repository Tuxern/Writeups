# USN CTF Competition - 15.01.23

On 15.01.23, Kongsberg Cyber Security Center (KCSC) hosted a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition at University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) Campus Vestfold. The competition included a variety of challenges across different categories such as Misc, pwn, Web, Reversing, Forensics, Crypto and OSINT. I participated in the team Navier, and we were able to capture first place in the competition.

The competition was designed to test our skills in various areas of cybersecurity. We had to use our knowledge of different tools and techniques to solve the challenges. The competition required skills in areas such as:
- Misc: Problem-solving and lateral thinking
- pwn: Exploit development and binary exploitation
- Web: Web application security and penetration testing
- Reversing: Reverse engineering and code analysis
- Forensics: Digital forensics and incident response
- Crypto: Cryptography and code breaking
- OSINT: Open-source intelligence gathering

Our team was able to successfully solve almost all of the challenges  and come out on top. This competition was a great opportunity to test and improve our skills in different categories of cybersecurity.

We would like to thank the organizers of the event, specifically KCSC, for hosting such a challenging and fun competition. We look forward to participating in future CTF events and continuing to improve our skills across different categories of cybersecurity.
